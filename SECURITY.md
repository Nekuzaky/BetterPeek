## Reporting a vulnerability

This is a client-side Minecraft mod with no network surface and no
authentication. The most plausible vulnerabilities involve:

- crash-on-render from a malformed `ContainerComponent` on a shulker box ItemStack
- memory exhaustion from an attacker-controlled container with an oversized
  inventory entry list

If you find something that fits, please **don't open a public issue**.
Instead, use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

1. Go to <https://github.com/Nekuzaky/BetterPeek/security/advisories/new>.
2. Describe the vulnerability, reproduction steps, and impact.

You should expect an acknowledgement within a few days. A fix and a public
advisory will follow once a patch is available.

For routine bugs (crashes that aren't security-relevant, weird preview
behaviour) please use the regular [issue tracker](https://github.com/Nekuzaky/BetterPeek/issues).
